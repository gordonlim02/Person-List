# NamesDB

## Why NamesDB

We have all had that moment of recognizing someone, 
but we just can't remember their name. Then,
we have to awkwardly ask, "Sorry, what's your name again?" 
If there is a simple application to write down names, then this
kind of situation would happen a lot less often.

## What you can do with NamesDB

With *NamesDB*, you can easily access and store all the names and 
information of people you have met. 
**Anyone** who finds it hard to remember names of other
people can be a user of *NamesDB*.

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on the project, I would create fields of LogPrinter,
JsonReader, and JsonWriter in the GUI class. Adding those fields to the GUI class
makes it easier for methods in the GUI class to utilize the classes, without
creating unnecessary instances of the objects.
